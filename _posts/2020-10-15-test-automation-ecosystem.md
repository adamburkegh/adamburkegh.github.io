One session at WCNGT 2020 that particularly chimed with me was by Anaïs van Asselt on [Sustainable Test Automation](https://medium.com/detesters/characteristics-of-a-sustainable-test-automation-garden-f4132bf12e68). She framed the challenges of test automation in terms of a garden and an ecosystem. It's not the first use of the metaphor, but I liked the way this talk very neatly brought in both technical choices and social interactions, and the way she was able to connect different elements under that one scheme. A lot of the activities she highlighted were strikingly architectural: mapping out a technical toolset and its interactions, thinking about the underlying drivers for the design, and coaching stakeholders so they made decisions in the context of a larger system evolution.

I argued in [Platform QA](/2019/02/07/platform-qa.html) that for agile software contexts, if dedicated automation engineers have a role, it is one with a mandate for an entire platform. That also requires system design thinking, and partnership with architects, in the contemporary [Gregor Hohpe sense](https://martinfowler.com/articles/architect-elevator.html). Michael Feathers has also has some good thoughts on [code gardening](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/detecting-shoved-code).
