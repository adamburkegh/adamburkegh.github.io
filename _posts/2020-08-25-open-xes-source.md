[OpenXES](http://www.xes-standard.org/openxes/start), the open source implementation of the XES event log standard, was originally distributed with source code in the tarball. Later versions, including 2.26, are class-only jarfiles.

The source is still available, but it's not linked well on the site. You can find it at the Eindhoven repo at [https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/prom/OpenXES/trunk/](https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/prom/OpenXES/trunk/), or through a [richer UI showing some recent source control context](https://svn.win.tue.nl/trac/prom/browser/OpenXES/trunk).
