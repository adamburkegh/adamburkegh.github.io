The villanelle is a highly structured poem involving not just a specific rhyme scheme, but, more unusually, the repetition of particular lines. Though examples exist from the sixteenth century, it was defined as a fixed form by French poet Theodore de Banville in the nineteenth. A number of well-known English language poets used the form in the twentieth century. Seamus Heaney wrote a villanelle about Harvard. Dylan Thomas’s “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night” is a villanelle. Sylvia Plath used it to write a love song.
