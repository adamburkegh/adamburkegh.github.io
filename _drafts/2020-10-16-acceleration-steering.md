Machine learning is brilliant but opaque, and a generator of technical debt. The concept of ML models as "black boxes" is very visible in the media now, perhaps a little less so when I gave this talk at DevOps 2018 in Singapore.

Technical debt is not the only bad consequence of unmanaged models, and it gets blamed for many things today, not without reason, but not necessarily with a lot of technical precision. I framed this with ML as an accelerant, which requires new elements of control to use effectively. And DevOps techniques are about gaining control over your software process. 

This is not central management control! Management gets results, but can't be a bottleneck on everyday decisions. On the contrary, it's only by giving individual team members control over quality that makes Agile and DevOps techniques work. The ability to make frequent, relevant adjustments allows problems to be caught through early feedback, and engineered out throughout the process. Therefore: ML as accelerant, DevOps as steering wheel.
